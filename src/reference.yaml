        The Currencycloud API authentication and authorization endpoint.

        Submit a login ID and API key for a Currencycloud account. On successful
        login, a temporary authentication token is returned.

        An authentication token is required to make requests to all other
        endpoints in the Currencycloud API. Tokens expire after 30 minutes of
        inactivity.

        Token requests are limited to 10 calls per minute.

        For security, Currencycloud accounts are disabled when four unsuccessful
        login attempts are made within a short period. Account holders must
        [contact support](https://developer.currencycloud.com/support) to
        reactivate their account.
