      description: >-
         This endpoint provides a list of upcoming non-trading dates, such as weekends or
         public holidays, for a specified currency pair. Common use cases
         include  situations where this information needs to be provided, or for
         planning upcoming conversion bookings. <br><br>
         Many currencies are triangulated; which means that holidays affecting the intermediary
         currency, as well as the sale and purchase currencies, will impact transactions.<br><br>
         Please note that since APAC currencies do not support the `conversion_date_preference`
         parameter on the conversions/create endpoint, `default_conversion_date` returned
         in this response should be used and not the `first_conversion_date` or `optimize_liquidity_conversion_date`.
