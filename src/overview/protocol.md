# Protocol
The Currencycloud API conforms to the HTTP 1.1 protocol, as defined by [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) through to [RFC 7235](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235).

All endpoints are accessible exclusively via the HTTP Secure (``https://``) transport layer. Requests to standard HTTP are not redirected to HTTPS and so will fail.
