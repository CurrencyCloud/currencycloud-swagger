# Methods
The Currencycloud API uses only two HTTP verbs: ``GET`` and ``POST``.

The ``GET`` method is used to retrieve one or more resources without modification. ``POST`` is used to create, update and delete resources.

The Currencycloud API does not use ``DELETE``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH`` or other HTTP verbs.
