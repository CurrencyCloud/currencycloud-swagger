# Adding an FX Spread/Markup

Adding a markup to an indicative rate enables you to earn a profit on a forex trade. This guide demonstrates how to add a markup to the indicative rate requested for an end customer. The calculated markup is passed in the conversion request to lock in the desired rate. Please note that markup is only supported when executing conversions on behalf of a sub-account (also known as a named account). Please refer to our [sub-account activity guide](/guides/integration-guides/sub-account-activity) for more information on how to conduct activity at the sub-account level.

Any profit earned on conversions is generated at the sub-account level and aggregated to your house account. These profits are reconciled and paid out as a monthly commission. Please contact your dedicated Sales Representative or Account Manager for more detail on commission payouts. 


## Step 1: Login

Please refer to the [authentication guide](/guides/integration-guides/authentication) for instructions for establishing a new API session.

## Step 2: Get a quote

As an example, let's check how much it will cost to buy 10,000 EUR using funds from your customer's GBP balance, by making a call to the [Get Detailed Rates](/api-reference/#get-detailed-rates) endpoint.

`GET /v2/rates/detailed`

| Parameter Name | Parameter Type | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `buy_currency` | Query String | `EUR` |
| `sell_currency` | Query String | `GBP` |
| `amount` | Query String | `10000.00` |
| `fixed_side` | Query String | `buy` |
| `on_behalf_of` | Query String | `1b0d6b8d-1d61-445d-8cda-a73e4c24265c` |
| `X-Auth-Token` | Header | `ea6d13c7bc50feb46cf978d137bc01a2` |

On success, the response payload will contain details of Currencycloud's quotation to make the conversion. The following response shows  that your customer can sell £8,057 to buy €10,000. Please note, the quote is only indicative and a conversion must be booked to lock a rate.

{
  "settlement_cut_off_time": "2021-07-15T13:30:00Z",
  "currency_pair": "EURGBP",
  "client_buy_currency": "EUR",
  "client_sell_currency": "GBP",
  "client_buy_amount": "10000.00",
  "client_sell_amount": "8057.00",
  "fixed_side": "buy",
  "client_rate": "0.8057",
  "partner_rate": "0.8057",

  "deposit_required": false,
  "deposit_amount": "0.0",
  "deposit_currency": "GBP",
  "mid_market_rate": "0.8056"
}
```

## Step 3: Calculate the markup within your application

Using your own internal mechanism, you can calculate and add a markup to the `client_rate `from the response payload in step 2. You can then display this marked-up rate including the appropriate buy/sell amounts, also known as  the "all in price" (`client_buy_amount` or `client_sell_amount`, depending on which side is fixed) to your end customer for final approval before executing the conversion request. 

You need to mark up the conversion to accumulate any profit. To accomplish this, the marked-up rate should be further away from the mid-market rate than the `core_rate`. The `mid_market_rate `in the above response payload is 0.8056. The `core_rate` - the rate Currencycloud is receiving from our liquidity provider and passing on to you - is 0.8057. This is higher than the mid-market rate because the markets consider GBP to be the stronger currency of the pair, your marked-up rate must therefore be higher than 0.8057.

In this situation, the markup is **added** to the `client_rate`. When the `core_rate` is lower than the `mid_market_rate`, the markup is **subtracted** from the `client_rate`. This would be the case if we were buying GBP and selling EUR, for example.

For our example, let's say you want to markup the `client_rate` by 0.5%. In this case, the rate that you would display to the end customer would be approximately 0.8097.

0.8057 + (0.005 X 0.8057) = 0.8097

Since the buy-side of the rate request was fixed in step 2 (by setting the `fixed_side` to "buy"), we need to reflect the markup in the `client_sell_amount` parameter. This should be displayed to your customer within your UI for approval and included in the conversion request as detailed in step 4.

We calculate the `client_sell_amount` by multiplying the marked-up rate with the amount.

0.8097 * 10000 = 8097

Bear in mind that if setting the `fixed_side` to "buy", you should adjust and include the `client_sell_amount` in your conversion request. If the `fixed_side` is "sell", you should adjust and include the `client_buy_amount `in your conversion request.

## Step 4: Submit the conversion

Once your customer is happy with the quote, you can create the conversion by calling the [Create Conversion](/api-reference/#create-conversion) endpoint, factoring in the calculated FX markup from step 3 by passing in and fixing the `client_sell_amount` parameter. Passing in the value, rather than the marked-up rate, allows you to honor the amounts with your customers, while managing the risk of rate fluctuation.

This conversion will settle automatically on the `settlement_date` as long as there are sufficient funds in the account's GBP balance to cover the `client_sell_amount`. Please use your Cash Manager to top up your GBP balance if necessary.

Inspecting the `partner_buy_amount` and `partner_sell_amount `parameters shows that you are selling £8,057 to buy €10,000, this is the cost of the trade without markup.

The `client_buy_amount` and `client_sell_amount` parameters give the customer's costs for the trade, factoring in the 0.5% markup. The customer is selling £8097 to buy €10,000.

Your profit on this trade is the difference between the `client_sell_amount `and `partner_sell_amount` parameters; you will therefore make a profit of £40 on this trade. This will be processed and transferred to the house account at the end of the month.
